Personal Projects Repository
Welcome! If you're reading this README, you're likely a recruiter or someone interested in hiring. This repository contains some of my personal projects that I’ve worked on in my spare time to test my skills or explore new techniques. Below, you’ll find an overview of the main directories in this repository:

Trading: This is a program I developed for personal use, which I’m now making public. It's a bit complex and wasn’t designed for others to use. I used it to study Python and to explore the integration of ChatGPT into my projects. You’ll find a more detailed README file within this directory.

Bash: This folder contains a collection of Bash scripts that I created to optimize my manual workflow. I have an intermediate level of proficiency in Bash.

Feel free to explore the projects and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
