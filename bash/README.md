This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts that I have written to automate and simplify repetitive manual tasks. Each script is designed to handle specific operations efficiently, reducing the need for manual intervention and saving time.

Purpose: Automate routine tasks that would otherwise be performed manually.
Scripts: Each script in this collection serves a unique purpose, ranging from file manipulation to network management and system monitoring.
